# Quickstart

This guide will take you from **unboxing to first command** in just a few minutes.  
By the end, your Cube will be awake, connected, and ready to help.

---

## 1. Power On Sequence

1. Place TheCube on your desk and connect the included power supply.  
2. TheCube will automatically power on when plugged in.  
3. TheCube will boot ‚Äî this usually takes **under 20 seconds**.  
4. You‚Äôll hear a startup chime when the system is ready.  

If after 45 seconds you don‚Äôt hear the chime, try:
- Checking the power connection
- Ensuring the power supply is plugged into a working outlet
- Restarting TheCube by unplugging and plugging it back in

## 2. Onboarding

Depending on your setup, you can complete onboarding via **mobile, desktop browser, or touchscreen:**

- **Mobile / Desktop: (web browser)**  
  1. Connect to the Cube‚Äôs Wi-Fi hotspot (`TheCube-XXXX`).  
  2. Open [http://thecube.local](http://thecube.local) in your browser.  
  3. Follow the guided setup to join your home Wi-Fi and link (optionally) to a TheCube+ account.  

- **Mobile App:**  
  1. Download the TheCube app from your app store (iOS or Android).
  2. Allow the app to control your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so that it can find TheCube.  
  3. The app will automatically detect TheCube and guide you through setup.

- **Touchscreen (optional):**  
  1. On first boot, you‚Äôll see the setup wizard.  
  2. Enter Wi-Fi details and preferences directly on-screen.  
  3. Finish by choosing a personality mode (you can change this later).  

During onboarding you can also:  
- Pick a **personality** (serious, playful, or random).  
- Configure **voice settings** (language, wake word).
- Set up **Wi-Fi** to connect to your home network.
- Opt-in to **analytics** to help improve TheCube (optional).
- Decide whether to connect to **TheCube+ cloud services** or stay fully local.

## 3. First Voice Command

Once setup is complete, wake TheCube with:  

- "Hey Cube"


Then try something simple, like:  
- ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúRemind me to drink water in 10 minutes.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúTell me a joke.‚Äù  

The on screen character will respond with a friendly animation and voice.
